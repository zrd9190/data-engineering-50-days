# Day 1: Understanding Data Engineering
  ## Key learnings
  - Data engineers build and maintain data pipelines
  - ETL/ELT processes are core to data engineering
  - Cloud platforms are essential in modern data engineering
  - Python and SQl are fundamental skills

  ## Important Concepts

  - **Data Pipelines** : Automated flow of data from source to destination
  - **ETL**: Extract, Transform, Load - traditional approach
  - **ELT**: Extract, Load, Transform - modern cloud approach
  - **Data Lake**: Storage for raw data in various formats
  - **Data Warehouse**: Structured storage optimized for analytics

    ## Questions for Tomorrow
     - How do I choose between ETL and ELT?
     - What makes a good data pipeline?
     - Which cloud platform should I focus on first?
